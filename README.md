SliMmom App
Overview
SliMmom is a web application designed to help mothers maintain a healthy lifestyle. The app provides essential features for tracking daily calorie intake, personalized nutritional recommendations, and managing food consumption.

This is my first Full-Stack Developer project, which I developed entirely on my own, from concept to deployment, using best practices in web development.

Calorie Calculator – Calculate daily calorie intake based on individual requirements.
Nutritional Recommendations – Get food suggestions based on blood type.
Food Diary:

Quick food search – Easily find calorie and nutritional information.
Diary Calendar – Track and visualize food habits over time.

Development & Implementation
Slimmom is a project I developed entirely on my own, making it my first full-stack experience. I handled all aspects of the application, including:

✅ Frontend: React, MUI, Redux-Toolkit
✅ Backend: Node.js, Express.js
✅ Database: MongoDB
✅ Authentication: JSON Web Token (JWT) for secure user accounts
✅ Deployment: GitHub Pages (Frontend) & Heroku (Backend)
✅ API Documentation: Swagger

This project was a valuable learning experience, allowing me to apply key full-stack development concepts and understand how to manage a complete application, from backend to frontend.
